Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Data Analytics

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a structured healthcare dataset containing over 4,000 records and 14 medical attributes to identify and model the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with a specific emphasis on predicting the likelihood of heart attacks. The project employs a combination of statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive data visualization to uncover patterns within patient records and provide actionable health insights through a dynamic dashboard.


Objective
The primary goals of this project were:
To conduct a thorough inspection of the dataset, including the identification of missing values, duplicates, and structural characteristics. To explore the data using statistical summaries and visual techniques that highlight trends in age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, thalassemia, and gender. To distinguish between categorical and continuous variables and analyze their relationship with cardiovascular risk. To develop a logistic regression model for predicting heart attack risk and validate it using a confusion matrix. To utilize pair plots and visual exploration tools to study correlations across all variables. To build an interactive Tableau dashboard that contrasts healthy versus at-risk individuals and illustrates the relationships between key health indicators.

Key Features
1. Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset was imported from an Excel source and cleaned through the treatment of missing values and the removal of duplicates. Structural integrity and completeness were confirmed before proceeding with deeper analysis. Summary statistics were generated to better understand data distributions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was used to visualize categorical variables through count plots and histograms. The analysis examined the incidence of heart disease by age group, explored anomalies in resting blood pressure, and evaluated gender composition. Cholesterol levels, thalassemia, and exercise-related features were also explored for their potential impact on heart disease.

3. Statistical Modeling and Prediction
A logistic regression model was implemented to predict the probability of heart attacks based on key variables. Model validation was conducted using a confusion matrix to assess its predictive performance. Pair plots were used to explore inter-variable relationships and to support feature selection.

4. Dashboarding and Visualization
An interactive dashboard was developed using Tableau to present findings visually. It allowed users to compare the profiles of healthy and diseased individuals, explore the role of various attributes, and interact with health trend data in a meaningful way. The dashboard was designed to support future updates through dynamic data integration.

5. Additional Insights
The project provided a comprehensive look at how various demographic and medical factors correlate with cardiovascular health. It allowed for deeper understanding of high-risk profiles and can be used as a foundation for preventive strategies in healthcare settings.

Summary of Achievements
The project demonstrated a complete data analytics pipelineâ€”from raw data cleaning and exploration to predictive modeling and visual storytelling. It identified key health indicators strongly associated with heart attack risk and validated these findings with statistical rigor. The use of Tableau enhanced accessibility and stakeholder engagement through clear, dynamic visual representations of complex health data.

Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of combining data analysis, machine learning, and visualization to solve real-world healthcare problems. By predicting cardiovascular risk using patient-level data and representing it through an interactive dashboard, the project supports data-driven decisions in medical research, clinical screening, and public health policy. It showcases the power of data science in uncovering critical insights that can save lives.
