# predictive-model-loan-heart-risk
This project focuses on building a statistical and predictive modeling pipeline using a dataset containing over 4,000 entries and 14 attributes. The primary objective is to analyze health-related data to identify and evaluate key factors contributing to the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly heart attacks.

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive healthcare dataset containing over 4,000 records and 14 attributes to uncover insights into the risk factors behind cardiovascular diseases (CVD), particularly heart attacks. Alongside this, the project also models potential loan demand across different U.S. regions and incorporates a dashboard that refreshes periodically based on new data retrieved from external agencies.

Through a structured approach involving data inspection, exploration, modeling, and visualization, the project applies statistical and machine learning techniques to build meaningful predictions and business insights.

Objective
The main goals of this project are:

To inspect and clean the dataset by handling missing values, detecting duplicates, and understanding the structure of the data.

To explore data visually and statistically, focusing on demographic and clinical variables influencing CVD.

To model and predict the occurrence of heart attacks using logistic regression and other techniques.

To analyze the correlation between health indicators and financial factors such as loan demand.

To build an interactive dashboard that presents real-time insights into patient profiles and loan projections.

Key Features
1. Data Import and Cleaning

Loaded data from an Excel source.

Identified and treated missing values and duplicate records.

Produced summary statistics for all numerical and categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used count plots and histograms to understand distributions.

Studied CVD incidence by age, gender, and resting blood pressure anomalies.

Examined cholesterol, thalassemia, and peak exercise metrics as risk indicators.

3. Modeling and Prediction

Investigated multivariate relationships using pair plots.

Built a logistic regression model to predict heart attack likelihood.

Validated predictions using a confusion matrix for accuracy.

4. Dashboard Development

Created interactive Tableau dashboards.

Compared profiles of healthy vs. diseased individuals.

Showcased the relationship between attributes in a dynamic view.

Enabled periodic refresh using live data connections.

Summary of Achievements
Developed a complete data science workflow from raw data to insights.

Modeled healthcare risk and financial demand with predictive accuracy.

Delivered a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders and decision-makers.

Aligned analytics with real-world health and economic objectives.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of data analytics, statistical modeling, and visualization tools to address critical questions in both healthcare and financial sectors. By identifying key predictors of heart disease and modeling loan demand, the project contributes to smarter, data-driven decision-making processes.
